    <h2>Who was Suzanne Aubert?</h2>
    <p>Suzanne Aubert was a woman, turned priest who was born in France all the way back in 1835. <br> She was born in a family of 6, with her mother, her father, and 3 younger siblings. <br> She is mainly known for educating underdeveloped and foreign kids in Australia and New Zealand, building schools for said children with other sisters who wanted to help them as well, and was considered worthy of her being beatified many years after her untimely death in October 1st, 1926 when she was surprisingly 91 years old. Despite the state of the world in the early 1900's, I'm actually surprised that she lived that long</p>

    <h2>Where did Suzanne Aubert carry out her missions?</h2>
   <p> Some of the places where Suzanne Aubert had carried her many religious missions throughout her younger days are some nearby towns and villages within the outskirts of France, large towns and regions in south Australia like New South Wales, and many towns and settlements from the north island of New Zealand. There may have been other places she went to for the needs of other helpless people but I couldn't find that much information about them.</p>
